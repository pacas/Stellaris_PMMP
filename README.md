# Alternative Stellaris launcher with advanced mod manager for Stellaris v2.4+
Greetings to all, this is the github rep of the PMMP mod manager.
This mod manager with a built-in launcher has a very simple design with advanced functionality.
 
Download installer [here](https://github.com/pacas/Stellaris_PMMP/releases)
 
If you have Python 3 installed, you can use the script version (PyQt5 and psutil required)

All the main functions of the default launcher are included, and at the moment, in addition to this, there is:
* Moving a mod by index
* Backups system
* Additional information for mods
* Fast way to open mod page on Steam Workshop
* Menu for opening game directories
* More mods moving options
* Multilanguage support
* Additional error protection

Features under development:
* (maybe) Themes support
* Multiplatform support
* Others


Quick help:
- Save load order with Ctrl+S or with Program/Save load order
- RMB menu enabled
- Double click to switch mod state
- Drag & Drop working
- The manager uses the same files as the default launcher, so if there is an error in them, then it will not work too. Paradox, WHY?
- You can ask for help anytime on [this discord server](https://discord.gg/9JqvFrF)
